Before starting to code i whould recommend you guys to study binary number system as basics dont go gor in depth study 
just remember some terms that whould be sufficient


                                                      BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM
                                                      
                            ->>>>  it represents 1 & 0 , So whenever we are talking about binary number system we are generally taking about 1's & 0's 
        in background all information being send around is in binary so it whould really intelligent if we learn a little about binary
